## Binary Search Tree

# Our case is with BST with no Duplicates

# Special property Inorder traersal in bst gives increasing sorted sequence

# BST Search - time complexity O(h) h-height log(n) n - nodes

# Delete a Node 
## No child(leaf node), one child , two children (inorder sucessor i.e leftmost in right subtree)

# QUETIONS 
## print in range (X - Y)
## root to leaf path
